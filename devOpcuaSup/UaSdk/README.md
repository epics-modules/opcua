# Unified Automation C++ Based OPC UA Client SDK

## Status

:warning:
This module is stable, with some expected development to be happening.
Please contact the author [Ralph Lange](mailto:ralph.lange@gmx.de) for details.
:warning:

## Prerequisites

*   Unified Automation C++ Based [OPC UA Client SDK][unified.sdk]
    (1.5/1.6/1.7 are supported, as well as their evaluation bundles).
    
*   Windows and Linux builds are supported.

*   Using the evaluation binary bundles by Unified Automation (free download) is supported.
    However, the EVAL bundle contains a shared library (DLL), namely the stack component, see below, so only shared builds of this Device Support will work.

### Linux

*   For OPC UA security support (authentication/encryption), you need `libcrypto` on your system - both when compiling the SDK and when generating any binaries (IOCs).
    The name of the package you have to install depends on the Linux distribution: `openssl-devel` on RedHat/CentOS/Fedora, `libssl-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu.
    Use the `CONFIG_SITE.local` file in the module where the binary is created to set this option.
    
*   The OPC UA Client SDK sets `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF` as default.
    To create shared SDK libraries, build the SDK using
    
    ```Shell
    ./buildSdk.sh -s ON
    ```
    In many versions of the SDK, the `buildSdk.sh` build script does not apply the `-s ON` setting the the stack component. To fix this and create a complete shared library set of the SDK, apply the following patch (shown for 1.5.5):

         # build
         make "$JOBS" || { echo "make failed."; exit 1; }
         # install
    ```

### Windows

*   Binary libraries (DLLs and headers) of matching versions for openssl and libxml2 are provided under the `third-party` directory of the SDK bundle.

## Building the device support module

Inside the `configure` subdirectory or one level above the TOP location, create a file `RELEASE.local` that sets `EPICS_BASE` to the absolute path of your EPICS installation.

Inside the `configure` subdirectory or one level above the TOP location, create a file `CONFIG_SITE.local` that sets the absolute path of your SDK installation as well as the SDK build and deploy features if necessary.

```Makefile
# Path to the Unified Automation OPC UA C++ SDK
UASDK = /usr/local/opcua/uasdkcppclient-v1.5.3-346/sdk

# How the Unified Automation SDK shared libraries are deployed
#   SYSTEM = shared libs are in a system location
#   PROVIDED = shared libs are in $(UASDK_SHRLIB_DIR)
#   INSTALL = shared libs are installed (copied) into this module
#   EMBED = link SDK code statically into libopcua,
#           SDK libraries are not required on target system
UASDK_DEPLOY_MODE = PROVIDED
UASDK_LIB_DIR = $(UASDK)/lib
UASDK_SHRLIB_DIR = $(UASDK_LIB_DIR)
# How the Unified Automation SDK libraries were built
UASDK_USE_CRYPTO = YES
UASDK_USE_XMLPARSER = YES
```

The SDK related configuration only has to be done in this module, which creates a `CONFIG_OPCUA` file that is automatically included by all downstream modules, so that the configuration is always consistent.

When using the evaluation bundle of the SDK, only regular (shared) builds are supported.
Do not set `STATIC_BUILD = YES` in your configuration.
Also, the evaluation bundle only contains binary libraries to be used with the MSVC compilers. MinGW can not be used with the libraries from the bundle (C++ name mangling is different.)

### Windows Specifics

Windows builds should use `UASDK_DEPLOY_MODE = PROVIDED` and set `UASDK` to the location of the Unified Automation bundle.

All paths in EPICS build configuration files must use Windows "short names" where needed, e.g.
```Makefile
UASDK = C:/PROGRA~2/UnifiedAutomation/UaSdkCppBundleEval
```

In your `CONFIG_SITE.local`, you also need to define the locations of the supplied third-party dependencies.

```makefile
# Prerequisites: libxml2 openssl
LIBXML2 = $(UASDK)/third-party/win64/vs2015/libxml2
OPENSSL = $(UASDK)/third-party/win64/vs2015/openssl
```

Different versions of the Unified Automation bundle have these libraries in different folders, under different names. Check `configure/CONFIG_SITE.Common.win32-x86` and adapt the settings to your situation.

If you do not have Administrator rights or if you want to unpack multiple versions of the UA SDK bundle in parallel, [UniExtract2][uniextract2] is your friend.

*Note:*
As always on Windows, the build environment as well as the runtime environment (for any IOC) need to have the locations of all DLLs in the PATH to be able to run binaries (which is part of the build for the unit tests). You will need to add the appropriate locations for EPICS Base, the opcua module, the UASDK library and all other dependencies you installed.
Alternatively, you can put copies of all needed DLLs into the location of the binaries. (Remember that `make distclean` will remove those copies.)

#### DLL Hell

Be aware that over time, Windows systems will have a large number of possibly different DLLs with the same names and/or versions being used concurrently on the system - a situation that is hard to maintain and known as [DLL Hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_Hell).

If you want your IOC binaries to be deployable without depending on specific DLLs being present on the target system, consider linking your IOCs statically. (As stated above, static builds are not available when
using the evaluation bundles.)

On newer Windows systems, the Windows system version of the openssl DLLs are not compatible with the UA SDK bundled versions (see below). The unit tests Makefile copies the vendor-supplied DLLs next to the test binaries to avoid a mismatch.

## Feedback / Reporting issues

Please use the GitHub project's [issue tracker](https://github.com/epics-modules/opcua/issues).

## Known issues

Reported by Shi Li (ASIPP):
The C++ SDK version 1.7.1 has a bug that shows as monitored items not getting updates anymore after the server has disconnected and reconnected. A reboot of the IOC restores good behaviour until the server disconnects again. Updating the C++ SDK to version 1.7.2 resolves the issue.

Reported by Carsten Winkler (HZB/BESSY):
On Windows 10, you may experience a version mismatch between the openssl DLLs that are part of the Windows system and a different version of the same DLLs that are part of the UA SDK bundle.
In that case, copying the DLLs from the UA SDK into the same directory as the unit tests (`...\unitTestApp\src\O.win...`) and your executable (IOC binary) seems to be the only reasonable workaround.
